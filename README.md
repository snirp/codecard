# Codelet
Learn programming concepts and **remember** what you learned through spaced repetition. Codelets are like intelligent flash cards for programmers and others. 

## Motivation
Developers gain knowledge every day through blogs, documentation and courses. Codelet makes sure none of that knowledge is lost, by applying "spaced repetition". Revisit cards with concepts you studied before or answer questions to keep your skills sharp.

## Technology stack

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The web framework
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database storage
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - Front-end framework

## Features
You can formulate your own questions, cards and courses or follow along an existing course. 

#### Cards
A card explains a programming concept, using the full power of markdown. The cards are git-versioned and anybody can contribute to them.

#### Questions
A card has multiple choice questions to test your knowledge. A weekly quiz will revisit your knowledge.

#### Course
A course is a collection of cards. Anyone can create or follow a course and spaced repetition will ensure that the knowledge you gain, will not sink away.
